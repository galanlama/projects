SHUFFLING
BG
6/24/10 Draft 1

Shuffling he came in through the corridor. He doesn't walk... he shuffles. Seeing him from my office window is a surreal experience. He seems to glide... it is not a gracious, easy gliding. It is as if he were on wheels and an invisible hand were pushing him forward. His head is tilted to his right (he is left handed), while his hands rest on his sides. He seems to be heading in one direction while moving toward a different one. Perhaps, his feet work like his mind: aimlessly moving from one thing to the next. 

I've liked Mr. J since I started working here. He's a likable character, with a special gift to tell stories.
