** Seven unusual psychological techniques

    1. Psychological distance.
    2. Fast forward in time.
    3. Absurdist stimulation.
    4. Use bad moods.
    5. Combining opposites (Janusian thinking).
    6. Path of most resistance.
    7. Re-conceptualisation.
    8. Conterfactual mindset (what might have happened but didn't).
    9. Two problems are better than one (allow the complexity of
       problem stimulate broad thinking).
    10. Generic verbs (change main verbs of problem statement).
    11. Synonyms and category taxonomies (analyze the type of problem
        and come up with different ways of representing it).
    12. Fight! Fight! Fight! (being in social conflict seems to give
        people an intense motivated focus).
    13. Think love not sex.
    14. Stop daydreaming.
